## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Firebase Project: [Create a Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatX.git
    cd ChatX
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

    - Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
    - Add an Android app to your Firebase project and download the `google-services.json` file.
    - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
    - Add an iOS app to your Firebase project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
    - Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.

4. **Generate `firebase_options.dart`:**

    - Install the `flutterfire_cli`:

        ```sh
        dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
        ```

    - Configure your Firebase project with FlutterFire:

        ```sh
        flutterfire configure
        ```

   This will generate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file.

5. **Run the app:**

    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
